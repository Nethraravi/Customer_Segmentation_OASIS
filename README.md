# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation Analysis – Data Analytics Project

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Customer Segmentation Analysis** for an **E-commerce company** to identify different customer groups based on their purchasing behavior and characteristics.  
By using **data analytics and machine learning**, we can understand customer patterns and help the business design **targeted marketing strategies**, improve **customer satisfaction**, and enhance **overall profitability**.


## 🎯 Objective
To analyze customer behavior and segment them into meaningful clusters using **K-Means Clustering** based on their:
- Recency (how recently they purchased)
- Frequency (how often they purchase)
- Monetary value (how much they spend)
- Income

These segments enable **personalized marketing**, **customer retention strategies**, and **data-driven decision making**.


## 🧩 Steps Involved
### 1️⃣ Data Collection
- Collected the customer dataset containing demographic and transactional data.
- Dataset includes features like income, spending, recency, and purchase history.

### 2️⃣ Data Exploration & Cleaning
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- Cleaned and standardized data for analysis.

### 3️⃣ Descriptive Statistics
- Derived key metrics such as average income, purchase frequency, and spending distribution.
- Built RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model features.

### 4️⃣ Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
- Applied **K-Means Clustering Algorithm**.
- Used **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to find the optimal number of clusters.
- Standardized features for better clustering performance.

### 5️⃣ Visualization
- Created meaningful visualizations to understand and explain customer groups:
  - Elbow and Silhouette plots
  - Cluster scatter plots
  - Bar charts and boxplots for RFM features
  - Radar charts for comparing clusters

### 6️⃣ Insights & Recommendations
- Identified high-value, loyal, dormant, and high-income-low-spend customers.
- Suggested actionable business strategies for each group.


## 🧠 Key Insights
| Segment Type | Key Traits | Business Action |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Loyal / High-Value Customers** | High frequency, high monetary value, low recency | Loyalty rewards, VIP programs |
| **Dormant / Lost Customers** | High recency, low frequency | Reactivation campaigns, discounts |
| **High-Income, Low-Spend Customers** | High income, moderate spending | Upselling and premium offers |
| **Low-Value Customers** | Low income, low spend | Optimize marketing cost |


## 🧮 Technologies & Tools Used
| Category | Tools / Libraries |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Programming | Python (Jupyter Notebook) |
| Data Handling | Pandas, NumPy |
| Visualization | Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| Machine Learning | Scikit-learn |
| Environment | Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda |


## 📊 Results
- Successfully segmented customers into **distinct behavioral groups**.
- Generated **data-driven insights** for marketing and retention.
- Built visualizations that clearly communicate cluster differences.
